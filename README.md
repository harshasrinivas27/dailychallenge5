## Emergency Resource Dispatch Analyzer

### Name

Harsha Srinivas

### Registration Number

AP24110011613

### Description

This program analyzes resource requests given by different zones during a disaster drill. Some values may be wrong or unrealistic so the program first separates valid and invalid data and then groups them into demand categories.

It does:

* Takes total number of requests
* Takes each request from user
* Ignores negative values
* Classifies as No demand, Low, Moderate or High
* Applies my personal filtering rule
* Prints final dispatch report and counts

### Personalization Details

Full name without spaces length L = 14
PLI = L % 3 = 2

So program follows Rule C
Rule C means keep only Moderate Demand requests and remove others.

Because every student name length is different the output will also be different.

### Language Used

Python
